					<p><b><font face="Arial">What is Arizona's SB 1070?</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">
					<a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">
					SB 1070</a> was signed into law by Republican governor Jan 
					Brewer at the end of April. The law goes into effect on July 
					29, 2010. SB1070 makes it a state crime to be in the United 
					States without proper authorization. It authorizes local 
					police to arrest individuals where there is a &quot;reasonable 
					suspicion&quot; that they are unauthorized immigrants, and allows 
					individuals to sue the police if they feel that the law is 
					not being enforced.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">SB 1070 was widely opposed by Chicanos 
					and Native Americans in Arizona, who have called for a 
					national boycott of Arizona. In response, local activists 
					across the country have condemned the law as racist. They 
					have pressured local governments to criticize the law and 
					some localities have supported the boycott. In early July, 
					the Federal government filed suit to overturn the law and 
					get an injunction to prevent it from being enforced.</font></p>
					<p><b><font face="Arial">Why do opponents of the law call it 
					racist?</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">Opponents of SB 1070 say that the law 
					will lead to racial profiling and point out that a number of 
					native-born Chicanos have been arrested by police for not 
					carrying documentation that identifies them to be authorized 
					to be in the United States.</font></p>
					<p><b><font face="Arial"><a name="boycott"></a>Why the call 
					for the boycott?</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">Tourism is one of the largest 
					industries in Arizona. In the 1990's, the NAACP and other 
					African American and civil rights groups called a boycott of 
					Arizona because of Arizona's refusal to recognize the Martin 
					Luther King Junior birthday as a holiday.&nbsp; In response, 
					the Super Bowl was moved to California. Eventually, Arizona 
					recognized the date as a holiday.</font></p>
					<p><b><font face="Arial">Why did the Federal government file 
					suite against SB 1070?</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">The U.S. Constitution and Supreme 
					Court cases have established that the Federal government is 
					in charge of immigration and not the states. For example, 
					California
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_187_(1994)">
					Proposition 187</a>, which required local schools to collect 
					immigration documentation, was overturned in Federal courts. 
					Further, SB 1070 goes further than Federal laws, since it is 
					not a crime to be in the U.S. without authorization (it is a 
					civil offense, punishable by deportation, but not jail 
					time).</font></p>
					<p><b><font face="Arial">Why should Japanese Americans and 
					other Asian Americans be concerned about SB 1070?</font></b></p>
					<p><font face="Arial">The authors of SB 1070 see it as a 
					first step towards restricting legal immigration and 
					stripping citizenship from native-born children whose 
					parents are unauthorized. Restrictions on legal immigration 
					(such as the 2007 proposal to eliminate family reunification 
					visas) would have a huge impact on Asian Americans. The 
					proposal to take citizenship away from native-born children 
					was tried with the Chinese Americans. This was fought in the 
					courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, who ruled in 
					1898 in the
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark">
					United States v. Wong Kim Ark</a> that all native-born are 
					citizens, as established in the
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">
					14th Amendment</a> to the Constitution and English common 
					law. SB 1070 is also like the
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Alien_Land_Law_of_1913">
					California Anti-Alien Land Law</a>, in that it makes no 
					mention of race, but is clearly aimed at the non-white 
					communities.</font></p>
