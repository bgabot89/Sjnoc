									commemorates&nbsp;the signing of
									<a href="http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/index.html?dod-date=219" target="_blank">Executive Order 9066</a>, which led to the 
									forced incarceration of 120,000 people of 
									Japanese descent, two-thirds of whom were 
									American citizens. This year’s event 
									features speakers:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.minamitamaki.com/attorneys/daleminami/" target="_blank">Dale 
									Minami,</a> the lead attorney on the legal 
									team that overturned the conviction against
									<a href="http://korematsuinstitute.org/institute/aboutfred/" target="_blank">Fred Korematsu</a>, who defied the World War 
									II Japanese American mass incarceration 
									order which led to the controversial United 
									States Supreme Court case;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/personality/landmark_korematsu.html" target="_blank">Korematsu 
									v. United States</a>;
									<a href="http://honda.house.gov/" target="_blank">Congressman Mike Honda</a>; and
									<a href="http://www.jamsj.org" target="_blank">Japanese 
									American Museum of San Jose (JAMsj) </a>former president and current board member, 
									Joe Yasutake. &nbsp;<br><br>The event will also 
									recognize the 70th anniversary of the 
									landmark Korematsu v. United States Supreme 
									Court case. In 1942, Fred Korematsu refused 
									to comply with the executive order and did 
									not go to the government’s incarceration 
									camps for Japanese Americans. After 
									Korematsu was arrested and convicted of 
									defying the government’s order, he appealed 
									his case all the way to the Supreme Court. 
									In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled against 
									him, arguing that the incarceration was 
									justified due to military necessity.<br><br>
									In 1983, University of California San Diego 
									professor Peter Irons and researcher Aiko 
									Herzig-Yoshinaga discovered Deparment of 
									Justice documents that revealed that &quot;the 
									government knowingly withheld information 
									from the courts when they were considering 
									the critical question of military necessity 
									in this case&quot;
									<a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/pp/korematsu_II.htm">
									[1]</a>. The documents demonstrated that 
									Japanese Americans had committed no acts of 
									treason to justify mass incarceration. With 
									this new evidence, a pro-bono legal team 
									that included attorney Dale Minami and the 
									Asian Law Caucus, re-opened Korematsu’s 
									40-year-old case on the basis of government 
									misconduct. On November 10, 1983, 
									Korematsu’s conviction was overturned in a 
									federal court in San Francisco. It was a 
									pivotal moment in civil rights history.</font></p>
