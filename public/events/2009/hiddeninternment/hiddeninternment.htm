							<p>From December 1941

							and financed the mass abduction, forcible 
							deportation and internment of 2,264 men, women, and 
							children of Japanese ancestry from 13 Latin American 
							countries. The U.S. planned to use them as hostages 
							in exchange for Americans held by Japan. Over 800 
							Japanese Latin Americans were included in two prisoner of war exchanges 
							between the U.S. and Japan.</p>

							<p>Since the early 1980s, Mr. Shibayama has been 
							seeking proper acknowledgment and apology from the 
							U.S. government for the violation of his civil and 
							human rights.&nbsp; In the early 1990s, the U.S. 
							government declared him and other Japanese Latin 
							Americans to be ineligible for redress under the

							Japanese Americans</span>) because they were 
							“illegal aliens” at the time of internment.&nbsp; 
							Subsequent litigation on behalf of the Japanese 
							Latin Americans resulted in the controversial 
							Mochizuki settlement agreement, which Mr. Shibayama 
							rejected.</p>
							<p>Mr. Shibayama has continued to press for an 
							apology and equitable redress as a matter of 
							principle, through legislation, litigation and 
							grassroots education.&nbsp; Not having found justice 
							through the U.S. court system, Mr. Shibayama and his 
							two brothers appealed to the international community 
							by filing a petition with the
