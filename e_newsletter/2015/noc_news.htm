											<td class="auto-style10" colspan="2">
											<a name="Izu"></a>Izu reflected on how people, 
											especially young people, can 
											viscerally connect and understand 
											the difficult societal challenges 
											and concepts from events that took 
											place several decades before many of 
											them were born. “I have learned that 
											these stories transmitted down 
											through the generations document not 
											just important historical 
											information -- that otherwise would 
											be lost -- but also make it possible 
											for all of us to personally connect 
											with that history, making it a 
											‘living’ history.”<br><br>Izu is 
											very aware about the power of oral 
											histories through his own experience 
											and how they can help propel a 
											grassroots movement toward achieving 
											social justice. In the early 1980’s, 
											Izu became the first “official” 
											chairperson of
											<a href="http://www.sjnoc.org">
											Nihonmachi Outreach Committee (NOC)</a> 
											at a time when the organization 
											decided to become heavily involved 
											in the
											<a href="http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Redress%20movement/">
											Japanese American redress movement</a>. 
											During the early days, support for 
											redress was not widespread and there 
											were many prominent voices in the 
											local Japanese American community 
											who were reticent in supporting the 
											movement. During the redress 
											hearings, NOC encouraged, supported, 
											and prepared former incarcerees so 
											that they could finally tell their 
											emotional, heart-breaking stories to 
											the commissioners and to the public. 
											Many people heard those gripping 
											stories of hardship for the first 
											time, and many more people started 
											to embrace the cause.<br><br>
											“Stories are transformative in how 
											they can be integrated into our own 
											identity through their ability to 
											create tremendous empathy, “ Izu 
											said. “They can also be a powerful 
											way to build support and involvement 
											in the movement for social justice.”<br>
											<br>Izu is concerned about how 
											Japanese American internment is 
											examined in the present and about 
											what lessons people extract from 
											that experience. “My main concern 
											right now is whether the Japanese 
											American experience is being made 
											into an example of ‘American 
											exceptionalism’ with Japanese 
											Americans being considered ‘special’ 
											since they ‘deserved redress.’ I 
											would rather have people learn the 
											lesson that civil liberties need to 
											be protected for all people. The 
											liberties and rights one has under 
											the Constitution are not based upon 
											how ‘deserving’ one is, or how 
											loyally one acts. These rights are 
											guaranteed to all.”<br><br>“There is 
											a key lesson,” Izu continued, 
											“regarding the true meaning of civil 
											liberties that we must learn. It is 
											very relevant for today, including 
											everything from Ferguson to the 
											treatment of Muslim Americans. A 
											certain level of bravery and courage 
											is required to fight for this. That 
											is true patriotism and not the 
											scapegoating or fear mongering that 
											seems to remain popular in our 
											country's politics today.”<br><br>
