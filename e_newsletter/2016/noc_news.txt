Panel Discussion: "Stand up Against Scapegoating and Hate Mongering!"

Tuesday, January 12, 2016
7:00 pm

Wesley United Methodist Church
566 N. 5th Street,
San Jose, CA 95112

Join the ACLU Santa Clara Valley Chapter and the San Jose Japanese American community at a panel discussion of
civil liberties in the context of the recent escalation of xenophobia and anti-Muslim rhetoric in the wake of the attacks on Paris. The
debate over Syrian refugees, and the mass shooting in San Bernardino have also added to the atmosphere of heightened tensions.

Highlighted in the national debate, Japanese Americans have found that the WWII exclusion and incarceration have become a touchstone for
good and for ill:

* The mayor of Roanoke, VA has cited the exclusion and incarceration
   of Japanese Americans to be the model for how to look at Syrian
   refugees.
* Donald Trump has proposed a mandatory registration of Muslims in
   the U.S.
* Admirably, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington will not close doors
   to refugees citing the terrible experience that his state witnessed on
   Bainbridge Island.

We would like to make sure that our community, having experienced the
WWII internment, makes it clear that we oppose the scapegoating and
hate mongering now threatening more thoughtful discourse.  

Panel includes: JACL-SJ  JACL-SV, JACL-Sequoia, Asian Law
Alliance, Nihonmachi Outreach Committee, Santa Clara Valley Chapter –ACLU,
as well as other guests.

36th Annual San Jose
Day of Remembrance

"Wartime Hysteria"

Sunday, February 14, 2016
5:30pm-7:30pm

Morris Dailey Auditorium
San Jose State University
San Jose, CA 95192

Post-event reception: Yoshihiro Uchida Hall

Free and open to the public

Paid parking available at the West Parking Garage and at other nearby
locations.


The 2016 San Jose Day of Remembrance ( http://www.sjnoc.org )
commemorates the signing of Executive Order 9066, which led to the forced incarceration of 120,000 people of Japanese
descent, two-thirds of whom were American citizens. The 36th annual
event will take place at a historically significant venue, San Jose
State University, which played an important role during the forced
removal of Japanese Americans from San Jose and major parts of Santa
Clara County. On May 24 and May 25, the San Jose State College men's
gymnasium, now renamed Yoshihiro Uchida Hall, served as a registration
center that processed 2,847 people of Japanese descent before they
were incarcerated.


A featured speaker will be Jimi Yamaichi, a prominent leader in the
San Jose Japantown community, who will recount his memories of being
processed at the gymnasium and forcibly uprooted from his home during
those traumatic days of 1942.

The theme of the 2016 event is"Wartime Hysteria." In the Civil
Liberties Act of 1988, the U.S government acknowledged that "a great
injustice was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens of
Japanese ancestry" and that the acts were "motivated largely by racial
prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political
leadership."The 2016 Day of Remembrance theme warns against the rise
of wartime hysteria, as well as racial and religious discrimination,
in today's politically volatile, emotionally-charged environment as
the nation confronts the issues of war, refugees, and terrorism.

Other speakers include Congressman Mike Honda, who was incarcerated at the Amache
internment camp, Japanese American Museum of San Jose president and SJSU alumnus, Aggie
Idemoto, and other members from the community. The annual event will
also include a performance by the internationally acclaimed, San Jose
Taiko,and a special candlelight procession to Yoshihiro Uchida Hall, the same location where Japanese Americans
were processed before they were forcibly removed from the San Jose
area.

The event will be held on February 14, 2015, from 5:30-7:30 p.m, in
the Morris Dailey Auditorium. A post-event reception will take place in nearby Uchida Hall.
