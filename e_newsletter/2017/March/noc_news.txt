Solidarity March and Rally

Saturday, March 25, 2017
12:00 p.m - 1:30 p.m

San Jose Japantown to San Jose City Hall

On Saturday, March 25, 2017, the Nihonmachi Outreach Committee (NOC)
and the South Bay Islamic Association (SBIA) will be co-sponsoring a day of solidarity with
the American Muslim community.  A march of solidarity will begin in
San Jose Japantown and will end with a rally at San Jose City Hall.

75 years earlier, on March 24, 1942, the U.S. government imposed a
curfew on Japanese Americans living on the west coast.  The same day,
the first round-up of an entire community took place on Bainbridge
Island, Washington, across Puget Sound from Seattle.   The curfew
also led to one of the first acts of resistance, when Japanese
American lawyer Min Yasui deliberately broke the curfew to test the
legality of EO 9066 on March 28, 1942.

Following the November 2016 election, we have seen a rise in
anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments.  Then on January 27, 2017
President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13769, which sought to
ban travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.  In response, states
filed lawsuits that led to a court injunction against the ban, while
grassroots protests of thousands of people happened at airports across
the country.

NOC and the SBIA would like to invite you to a grassroots day of
solidarity between Japanese Americans and American Muslims on
Saturday, March 25, 2017.  The event will begin in San Jose Japantown
on 5th street between Jackson and Empire, and will proceed down 6th
street to a rally at San Jose City Hall on 5th and Santa Clara.  The
event is free and open to all who wish to oppose the growing
anti-Muslim sentiments and government actions today.
