					  </i><br><br>The event will also recognize the 70th anniversary of the 
					  landmark Korematsu v. United States Supreme Court case.&nbsp; 
					  In 1942, Fred Korematsu refused to comply with the 
					  executive order and did not go to the governments 
					  incarceration camps for Japanese Americans. After 
					  Korematsu was arrested and convicted of defying the 
					  governments order, he appealed his case all the way to 
					  the Supreme Court. In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled 
					  against him, arguing that the incarceration was justified 
					  due to military necessity.<br><br>In 1983, University of 
					  California San Diego professor Peter Irons and researcher 
					  Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga discovered&nbsp; Deparment of 
					  Justice documents that revealed that &quot;the government 
					  knowingly withheld information from the courts when they 
					  were considering the critical question of military 
					  necessity in this case&quot;
					  <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/pp/korematsu_II.htm">
					  [1].</a> The documents demonstrated that Japanese 
					  Americans had committed no acts of treason to justify mass 
					  incarceration. With this new evidence, a pro-bono legal 
					  team that included attorney Dale Minami and the Asian Law 
					  Caucus, re-opened Korematsus 40-year-old case on the 
					  basis of government misconduct. On November 10, 1983, 
					  Korematsus conviction was overturned in a federal court 
					  in San Francisco. It was a pivotal moment in civil rights 
					  history.<br><br><span class="auto-style9">
